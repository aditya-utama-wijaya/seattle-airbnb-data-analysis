# Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the Seattle Airbnb listings using the dataset from Kaggle.

## Dataset
The dataset in Kaggle consists of 3 files:
- `listings.csv`: including full descriptions and average review score
- `reviews.csv`: including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
- `calendar.csv`: including listing id and the price and availability for that day

The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).
For the purpose of this analysis, we will only explore the `listings.csv` file.

## Business Questions
There are several questions that we would like to answer using this analysis:
1. How is the distribution of listings price across different neighborhoods in Seattle?
2. How different is the price between superhost listings and non-superhost listings in Seattle?
3. What kind of listings has the highest and the lowest prices?
4. How many rooms do most listings have and which ones are the most pricey?
5. What are the most common amenities across listings and which ones usually exist in the most expensive listings?

You can find the blog post regarding this analysis [here].
